Fake_News_Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying news articles as either fake or real. The widespread distribution of fake news poses significant threats to society, making it crucial to develop systems that can identify such misinformation.

The model is trained and evaluated using a diverse dataset of news articles, leveraging multiple techniques and tools for accurate classification.

Tech Stack
Programming Language
Python: Used for all data processing, modeling, and evaluation tasks.
Libraries and Frameworks
Data Manipulation and Analysis

Pandas: For importing, processing, and analyzing the dataset.
Machine Learning

Scikit-learn:
Vectorization:
CountVectorizer for simple term-document frequency representation.
TfidfVectorizer for term frequency-inverse document frequency representation.
HashingVectorizer for memory-efficient, hash-based vectorization.
Classification Models:
MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes classifier for text data).
PassiveAggressiveClassifier (for online learning and binary classification tasks).
Model Evaluation:
Metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrices for performance evaluation.
Visualization

Matplotlib: For plotting confusion matrices to visualize model performance.
Numerical Computation

NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and matrix manipulations.
Itertools

For efficient looping and iterable manipulation.
Dataset
The dataset used is a CSV file named fake_or_real_news.csv, containing:

Text Data: The content of news articles.
Labels: Indicators specifying whether the news is "FAKE" or "REAL."
Features and Techniques
Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
Stopword removal to eliminate irrelevant words.
Three types of vectorization methods:
CountVectorizer for raw term frequencies.
TfidfVectorizer for weighted term frequencies.
HashingVectorizer for memory-efficient feature extraction.
Machine Learning Models
Naive Bayes Classifier (MultinomialNB):

Suitable for discrete data such as word counts or frequencies.
Used with different vectorization methods for comparison.
Passive Aggressive Classifier:

Ideal for large-scale text classification.
Works well for online learning scenarios.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy scores for overall model performance.
Confusion matrices to analyze the distribution of true and false predictions.
Results
The models are evaluated on the test dataset using different vectorization techniques. The performance is visualized through accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
